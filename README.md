This Python script serves as a voice-controlled assistant inspired by Amazon Alexa, utilizing libraries such as speech_recognition, pyttsx3, and pywhatkit. It enables users to interact with their computer via voice commands, such as playing YouTube videos, retrieving the current time, fetching information from Wikipedia, and generating jokes. With a focus on simplicity and ease of use, this project provides a foundation for building personalized voice-controlled applications and explores the integration of various Python libraries for natural language processing and speech recognition.
